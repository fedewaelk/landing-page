Landing Page Project
Introduction
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. It involves building a landing page based on a provided design. By completing this project, I will demonstrate my ability to:

Create structured and semantic HTML.
Use CSS for styling and layout design.
Apply flexbox techniques for aligning and organizing content.
Integrate custom fonts and colors to match a given design.
Work with reusable CSS classes for consistency.
Set up and manage a Git repository to track project progress.
The goal is to recreate the design as closely as possible while understanding the process of building a webpage from scratch.

Skills Demonstrated
Translating a visual design into code.
Structuring HTML documents logically and semantically.
Styling and layout with CSS, including flexbox for responsive alignment.
Managing content such as fonts, colors, and images effectively.
Using Git for version control, with meaningful commits during development.
This README serves as both an introduction and a reflection on the project, documenting the progress and key learnings achieved.
